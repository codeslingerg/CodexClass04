## Creating Hyperlinks
1. Content will need to be wrapped inside of a "a" element
2. The href contains the web address.
3. Making links more accessible is better through having a link title that has information hovering over it.

## CSS Layout
1. "Normal flow" is the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.
2. The differences between block-level and inline elements are that block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction and inline elements are don't appear on new lines; instead, they all sit on the same line along with any adjacent (or wrapped) text content as long as there is space for them to do so inside the width of the parent block level element.
3. Static positioning is the default for every html element.
4. A few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element are that can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page and can also specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides.
5. The difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. 

## Functions
1. The difference between a function declaration and a function invocation that a function declaration is a form of creating a function while invocation is done by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.
2. The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter is a value that needs to be included inside the function parentheses and an argument is a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
1. 2 benefits to pair programming are learning from fellow students and greater efficiency. This would help with better understanding how to code and findiong more effecient and easier routes to typing code. Learning from fellow students can help you with job readiness and social skills in the real world.
